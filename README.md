# Student-Activity-Center--SAC-DBMS
SAC - Student Activity Center forms the backbone of all extra-curricular activities organised in IIITV-ICD .Students are the life and soul of all educational enterprise. At the IIITV-ICD, Students have the unique opportunity of not just witnessing an Institution in the making but participating in the making as well. Winston Churchill once said that we shape our Institution and these in turn shape our lives. The heady experience of joining hands with the Director, the faculty and staff in deciding almost all aspects of campus life and in evolving a culture so unique to the IIIT of the Shivaliks is part of what makes our life at IIITV-ICD unique!
